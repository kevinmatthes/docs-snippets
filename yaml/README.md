# `./yaml/`

## Summary

This directory provides a set of common meta data for Pandoc.

## Description

Pandoc allows the specification of document related meta data using YAML blocks
at the source file's beginning.  These information may also be stacked such that
default values may be grouped in separate files depending on their category.
When compiling with Pandoc, the meta just needs to be named before the actual
content as input and it will be added to the resulting document properly.
